The YITH Request a Quote for WooCommerce plugin lets your customers ask for an estimate of a list of products they are interested into.

== Description ==

YITH Request a Quote for WooCommerce is a powerful tool to hide prices and/or add to cart buttons and let your customers request a custom quote for every product.

If you sell goods or services for which a label with price is not enough and you want to get in touch with your customers, a quote system is the perfect solution for your WooCommerce shop.

Our plugin allows displaying an “Add to Quote” button or link on your product pages. Customers can add products to a list, fill the form and then submit a request for a custom quote.

It is also possible to hide the “Add to cart” buttons to encourage customers to get in touch with the suppliers: in this way you can hide prices for wholesale or retailers and provide competitive custom prices based on their needs.

The admin will receive an email with the quote request and can reply with a custom quote.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I hide Add to cart button in single page product? =
Yes, in Yit Plugins > Request A Quote > Settings page, you can choose hide or show "Add to cart" button.

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YIT, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days.

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!

= How can I get more features for my WooCommerce plugin? =

= What are the main changes in plugin translation? =
Recently YITH Request a Quote for WooCommerce A has been selected to be included in the "translate.wordpress.org" translate programme.
In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'yit' to 'yith-woocommerce-request-a-quote'.
Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org.
During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in:

* yith-woocommerce-request-a-quote-[WORDPRESS LOCALE].po
* yith-woocommerce-request-a-quote-[WORDPRESS LOCALE].mo

= How can I report security bugs? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/yith-woocommerce-request-a-quote)
