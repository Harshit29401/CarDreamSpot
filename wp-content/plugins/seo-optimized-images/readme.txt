The SEO Optimized Images plugin lets you dynamically add SEO-Friendly "alt" and "title" attributes to your images.

== Description ==

The **SEO Optimized Images** plugin lets you dynamically insert SEO-Friendly "alt" and "title" attributes to your images. Simply activate the plugin, provide the pattern, and you are ready to go.
